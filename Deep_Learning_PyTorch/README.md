# Fashion-MNIST Classification Project
This project is about classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks. This project is part of the IBM course on AI, which aims to provide hands-on experience with machine learning and deep learning techniques.


## Preparation
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
PyTorch
torchvision
numpy
matplotlib

## Table of Contents
1. Data Preparation: create training and validation datasets
2. Train model 
- Create Convolutional Neural Network
- Define Softmax, Criterion Function, Optimizer, and Train the Model
- Plot Cost and Accuracy 
## Credits
This project was inspired by and uses materials from the IBM course "Deep Learning with PyTorch".
