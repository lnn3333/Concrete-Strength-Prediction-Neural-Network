Concrete Strength Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the concrete strength using a neural network built with the Keras library. The project is divided into four parts, each focusing on different aspects of model training and evaluation.

Part A: Build a Baseline Model (5 marks)
Requirements
Keras
Scikit-learn
Numpy
Pandas
Description
In this part, we build a baseline neural network model with the following specifications:

One hidden layer with 10 nodes and a ReLU activation function.
Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function.
Steps
Data Splitting: Randomly split the data into training and test sets by holding 30% of the data for testing using train_test_split from Scikit-learn.
Model Training: Train the model on the training data using 50 epochs.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test data and compute the mean squared error between the predicted and actual concrete strength using mean_squared_error from Scikit-learn.
Repetition: Repeat steps 1-3, 50 times, to create a list of 50 mean squared errors.
Reporting: Report the mean and the standard deviation of the mean squared errors.
